Hey There!

  This repository of mine consists of a showcase of my "Learnings of SaSS".

  It has "6 folders" each representing the important topics in SaSS through " 6 Simple Projects" which showcase the implementations of each of those topics. 
  Apart from these I have also explored SASS Operators, Functions, Interpolation and Directives(Loops).

  Moreover
  <b> "A  basic Portfolio site" </b> is also included in the folders .
